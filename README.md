This is a repository of my old Combat Arms hacks in development. Used to sell them but they have been patched ever since. I released them on MPGH almost a decade ago. Added my last screenshots of what they used to look like. Moveable menus, buttons, windows, etc.
This repository is no longer supported or updated. Only keeping it here since I worked so hard on it and I am better off keeping it on my GitHub than stored away in my extra drive.
