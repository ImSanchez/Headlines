# Headlines
This is a repository of my old Combat Arms hacks in development. Used to sell them but they have been patched ever since. I released them on MPGH almost a decade ago. Moveable menus, buttons, windows, etc.
This repository is no longer supported or updated. Only keeping it here since I worked so hard on it and I am better off keeping it on my GitHub than stored away in my extra drive.
